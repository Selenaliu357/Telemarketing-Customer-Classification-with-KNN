Telemarketing Customer Classification with KNN

Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and dataset for exploring customer segmentation based on telemarketing data using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. We perform data preprocessing, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning (choosing the optimal number of neighbors), and model evaluation on a multiclass classification task.
